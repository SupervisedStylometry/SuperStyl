So sgt. pepper took you by surprise You better see right through that mother's eyes Those freaks was right when they said you was dead The one mistake you made was in your head How do you sleep? Ah how do you sleep at night?  You live with straights who tell you "you was king" Jump when your mamma tell you anything The only thing you done was yesterday And since you've gone you're just another day How do you sleep? Ah how do you sleep at night?  A pretty face may last a year or two But pretty soon they'll see what you can do The sound you make is muzak to my ears You must have learned something all those years How do you sleep? Ah how do you sleep at night?
