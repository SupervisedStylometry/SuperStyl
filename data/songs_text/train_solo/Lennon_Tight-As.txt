Just as tight a$ you can make it Hard and slow ain't hard enough Just as tight a$ you can shake it girl Git it on and do your stuff  Tight a$ you can get it Tight a$ got it made Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat You better get back in the shade  Just as tight a$ an Indian rope trick Long and tough ain't hard enough Just as tight a$ a dope fiend's fix my friend Git it up and do your stuff  Tight a$ you can boogie Tight a$ got it made Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat you better get back in the shade  Well tight a$ got me cornered Tight a$ got me laid Tight a$ strut your stuff so tough Just a sweating in the midnight shade
