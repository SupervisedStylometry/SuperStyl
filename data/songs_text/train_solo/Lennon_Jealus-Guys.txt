I was dreaming of the past and my heart was beating fast I began to lose control I began to lose control I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry Oh my I didn't want to hurt you I'm just a jealous guy  I was feeling insecure You might not love me anymore I was shivering inside I was shivering inside Oh I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry Oh my I didn't want to hurt you I'm just a jealous guy  [Whistling]  I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry Oh my I didn't want to hurt you I'm just a jealous guy  I was trying to catch your eyes I thought that you were trying to hide I was swallowing my pain I was swallowing my pain I didn't mean to hurt you I'm sorry that I made you cry Oh my I didn't want to hurt you I'm just a jealous guy watch out baby I'm just a jealous guy Look out baby I'm just a jealous guy
