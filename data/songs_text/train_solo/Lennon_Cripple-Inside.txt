You can shine your shoes and wear a suit You can comb your hair and look quite cute You can hide your face behind a smile One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside  You can wear a mask and paint your face You can call yourself the human race You can wear a collar and a tie One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside  Well now, you know that your cat has nine lives, babe Nine lives to itself But you only got one And a dog's life ain't fun Mama, take a look outside  You can go to church and sing a hymn You can judge me by the colour of my skin You can live a lie until you die One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside  Take it, cousin  Well now, you know that your cat has nine lives, babe Nine lives to itself But you only got one And a dog's life ain't fun Mama, take a look outside  You can go to church and sing a hymn Judge me by the colour of my skin You can live a lie until you die One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside  One thing you can't hide Is when you're crippled inside
