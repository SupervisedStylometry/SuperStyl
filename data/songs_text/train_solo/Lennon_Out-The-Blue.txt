Out the blue you came to me And blew away life's misery Out the blue life's energy Out the blue you came to me  Every day I thank the Lord and Lady For the way that you came to me Anyway it had to be two minds One destiny  All my life's been a long slow knife I was born just to get to you Anyway I survived long enough To make you my wife  Like a U.F.O. you came to me And blew away life's misery Out the blue life's energy Out the blue you came to me
