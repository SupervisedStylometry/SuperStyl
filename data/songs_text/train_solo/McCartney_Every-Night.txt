Ev'ry night i just wanna go out, Get out of my head. Ev'ry day i don't wanna get up, Get out of my bed. Ev'ry night i want to play out And ev'ry day i wanna do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. But tonight i just wanna stay in And be with you-oo, And be with you.  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.  Ev'ry day i lean on a lamp post, I'm wasting my time. Ev'ry night i lay on a pillow, I'm resting my mind. Ev'ry morning brings a new day And ev'ry night that day is throuough. But tonight i just wanna stay in And be with you, And be with you.  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, believe me, momma. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, momma, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh........
