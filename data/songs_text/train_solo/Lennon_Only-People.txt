Only people just know how to talk to people Only people know just how to change the world Only people realize the power of people A million heads are better than one, so come on, get it on!  Well I know how we tried and the millions of tears that we cried Now we are hipper we been thru the trip And we can't be denied with woman and man side by side Make no mistake it's our future we're making, bake the cake and eat it too! We don't want no pig brother scene  Well it's long overdue there ain't nothing better to do Now we are hipper we been thru the trip We can fly right on thru, there's nothing on earth we can do Fish or cut bait it's our future e're making all together now pull the chain! We don't want no pig brother scene
