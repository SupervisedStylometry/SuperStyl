Too many people going underground, Too many reaching for a piece of cake. Too many people pulled and pushed around, Too many waiting for that lucky break.  That was your first mistake, You took your lucky break and broke it in two. Now what can be done for you? You broke it in two.  Too many people sharing party lines, Too many people never sleeping late. Too many people paying parking fines, Too many hungry people losing weight.  That was your first mistake, You took your lucky break and broke it in two. Now what can be done for you? You broke it in two.  Mm-mm-uh-uh.  Uh!  Too many people preaching practices, Don't let 'em tell you what you wanna be. Too many people holding back, This is crazy, and baby, it's not like me.  That was your last mistake, I find my love awake and waiting to be. Now what can be done for you? She's waiting for me
