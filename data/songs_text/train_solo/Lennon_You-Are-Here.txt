From Liverpool to Tokyo What a way to go From distant lands one woman one man Let the four winds blow  Three thousand miles over the ocean Three thousand light years from the land of the rising sun  Love has opened my eyes Love has blown right through Wherever you are, you are here  Three thousand miles over the ocean Three thousand light years from the land of surprising sun East is east and west is west The twain shall meet East is west and west is east Let it be complete  Three thousand miles over the ocean Three thousand light years from the land of the morning star
