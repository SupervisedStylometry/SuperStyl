Oh my love for the first time in my life My eyes are wide open Oh my lover for the first time in my life My eyes can see  I see the wind, oh I see the trees Everything is clear in my heart I see the clouds, oh I see the sky Everything is clear in our world  Oh my love for the first time in my life My mind is wide open Oh my lover for the first time in my life My mind can feel  I feel sorrow, oh I feel dreams Everything is clear in my heart I feel life, oh I feel love Everything is clear in our world
