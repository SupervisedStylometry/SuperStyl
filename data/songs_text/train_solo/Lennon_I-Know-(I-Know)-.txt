The years have passed so quickly One thing I've understood I am only learning To tell the trees from wood  I know what's coming down And I know where it's coming from And I know and I'm sorry (yes I am) But I never could speak my mind  And I know just how you feel And I know now what I have done And I know and I'm guilty But I never could speak my mind  I know what I was missing But now my eyes can see I put myself in your place As you did for me  Today I love you more than yesterday Right now I love you more right now  Now I know what's coming down I can feel where it's coming from And I know it's getting better all the time As we share in each other's minds  Today, I love you more than yesterday Right now, I love you more right now  Ooo, no more crying Ooo, no more crying Ooo, no more crying Ooo, no more crying
