Woman is the nigger of the world Yes she is... think about it Woman is the nigger of the world Think about it... do something about it  We make her paint her face and dance If she won't be a slave, we say that she don't love us If she's real, we say she's trying to be a man While putting her down we pretend that she is above us Woman is the nigger of the world... yes she is If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with Woman is the slave of the slaves Ah yeah... better scream about it We make her bear and raise our children And then we leave her flat for being a fat old mother hen We tell her home is the only place she should be Then we complain that she's too unworldly to be our friend Woman is the nigger of the world...yes she is If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with Woman is the slave to the slaves Yeah (think about it)  We insult her everyday on TV And wonder why she has no guts or confidence When she's young we kill her will to be free While telling her not to be so smart we put her down for being so dumb Woman is the nigger of the world... yes she is If you don't believe me take a look to the one you're with Woman is the slave to the slaves Yes she is... if you believe me, you better scream about it
