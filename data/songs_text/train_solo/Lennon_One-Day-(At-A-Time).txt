You are my weakness, you are my strength Nothing I have in the world makes better sense Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea When we're together or when we're apart There's never a space in between the beat of our hearts Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree  One day at a time is all we do One day at a time is good for you  You are my woman, I am your man Nothing else matters at all, now I understand That I'm the door and you're the key And every morning I wake in your smile Feeling your breath on my face and the love in your eyes Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee  One day at a time is all we do One day at a time is good for us two (you too)
