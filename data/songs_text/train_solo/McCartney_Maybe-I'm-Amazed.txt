Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you  Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time You hung me on the line Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you  Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man Who's in the middle of something That he doesn't really understand  Baby, I'm a man And maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me Baby, won't you help me to understand? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh  Baby, I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man Who's in the middle of something That he doesn't really understand  Baby, I'm a man And maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me Baby, won't you help me to understand? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you  Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song Right me when I'm wrong Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
