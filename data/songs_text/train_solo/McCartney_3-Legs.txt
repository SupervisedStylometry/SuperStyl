Well, when I walk, when I walk, Walk my horse upon a hill. Well, when I walk, walk, walk, walk, Walk my horse upon a hill. When I lay me down, Will my lover love me still?  A dog is here, A dog is there, My dog he got three legs But he can't run.  Well, when I thought, well, I thought, When I thought you was my friend. When I thought, well, I thought, When I thought you was my friend. But you let me down, ho, Put my heart around the bend.  A fly flies in, A fly flies out, Most flies they got three legs But mine got one.  Well, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly, When I fly above the clouds. Oh, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly, When I fly above the clouds. You can knock me down, with a feather, yes, you could, But you know it's not allowed.  A dog is here, A dog is there, My dog he got three legs But he can't run.  My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none, uh, uh, uh, My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none, My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none.
