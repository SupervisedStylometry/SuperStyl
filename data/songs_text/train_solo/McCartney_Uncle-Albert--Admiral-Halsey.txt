We're so sorry, uncle Albert, We're so sorry if we caused you any pain. We're so sorry, uncle Albert, But there's no one left at home And I believe I'm gonna rain.  We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day, We're so sorry, uncle Albert, But if anything should happen We'll be sure to give a ring.  "We're so sorry, uncle Albert, But we haven't done a bloody thing all day. We're so sorry, uncle Albert, But the kettle's on the boil And we're so eas'ly called away."  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, Doo-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, Uh-uh -  Hands across the water, heads across the sky, Hands across the water, heads across the sky.  Admiral Halsey notified me, He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea. I had another look and I had a cup of tea and a butter pie.  "Butter pie?" "The butter wouldn't melt, so I put it in the pie, alright!"  Hands across the water, heads across the sky, Hands across the water, heads across the sky.  Live a little, be a gypsy, get around, Get your feet up off the ground, Live a little, get around.  Live a little, be a gypsy, get around, Get your feet up off the ground, Live a little, get around.  Hands across the water, heads across the sky, Hands across the water, heads across the sky.
