We are born in a prision, raised in a prision Send to a prision called school,  We cry in a prision, We love in a prision, We live in a prision, like fools.  Wood becomes a flut when it's loved, reach for your self and your battered mates. Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken, Look in a mirror and see your shattered fate.  We live with no reason, Kicked around for no reason, Thrown out without reason like tools.  Work in a prision And hate in aprision And die in a prision as a rule.  We live in a prision Among judges and wardnes And wait for no reason or use We laugh in a prision, Go through all four seasons And die with no vision or truth
