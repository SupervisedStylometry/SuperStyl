They give him ten for two What else can the judges do? Gotta, gotta.....gotta, set him free.  If he had been a soldier man Shooting gooks in Vietnam If he was the CIA Selling dope and making hay He'd be free, they'd let him be Breatthing air, like you and me  They gave me ten for two What more can the judges do? Gotta, gotta....gottta set him freee.  Was he jailed for what he done?  Representing everyone Free john now, if we can From the clutches oof the man Let him free, lift the lid Bring him to his wife and kids. They gave me ten for two  What more can the bastards do? Gotta, gotta...gotta set him free...
