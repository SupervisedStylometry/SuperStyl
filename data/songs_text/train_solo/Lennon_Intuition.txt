My intentions are good, I use my intuition It takes me for a ride But I never understood other people's superstition It seemed like suicide And as I play the game of life I try to make it better each and every day And when I struggle in the night The magic of the music seems to light the way Intuition takes me there Intuition takes me everywhere  Well my instincts are fine I had to learn to use them in order to survive And time after time confirmed an old suspicion It's good to be alive And when I'm deep down and out and lose communication With nothing left to say It's then I realize it's only a condition Of seeing things that way Intuition takes me there Intuition takes me everywhere
