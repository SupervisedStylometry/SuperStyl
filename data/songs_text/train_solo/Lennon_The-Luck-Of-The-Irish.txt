If you had the luck of the Irish You'd be sorry and wish you were dead You should have the luck of the Irish And you'd wish you was English instead!  A thousand years of torture and hunger Drove the people away from their land A land full of beauty and wonder Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!  If you could keep voices like flowers There'd be shamrock all over the world If you could drink dreams like Irish streams Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn  In the 'Pool they told us the story How the English divided the land Of the pain, the death and the glory And the poets of auld Eireland  If we could make chains with the morning dew The world would be like Galway Bay Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns The world would be one big Blarney stone  Why the hell are the English there anyway? As they kill with God on their side Blame it all on the kids the IRA As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide!  If you had the luck of the Irish You'd be sorry and wish you was dead You should have the luck of the Irish And you'd wish you was English instead! Yes you'd wish you was English instead!
