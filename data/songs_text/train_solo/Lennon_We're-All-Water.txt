There may be not much difference Between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon If we strip them naked  There may be not much difference Between Marylin Monroe and Lenny Bruce If we check their coffins  There may be not much difference Between White House and Hall of People If we count their windows  There may be not much difference Between Raquel Welch and Jerry Rubin If we hear their heartbeat  We are all water from different rivers That's why it's so easy to to meet We are all water in this vast, vast ocean Someday we'll evaporate together  There may be not much difference Between Eldridge Cleaver and Queen of England If we bottle their tears  There may be not much difference Between Manson and the Pope If we press their smile  There may be not much difference Between Rockefeller and you If we hear you sing  There may be not much difference Between you and me If we show our dreams  We are all water from different rivers That's why it's so easy to to meet We are all water in this vast, vast ocean Someday we'll evaporate together  Hey! There's no difference! What's the difference? What's the difference? What? What? There's no difference! There's no difference! What's the difference?
