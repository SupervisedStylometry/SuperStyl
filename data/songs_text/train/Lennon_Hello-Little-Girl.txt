Hello little girl Hello little girl Hello little girl When I see you everyday I say, "Mm mm hello little girl" When you're passing on your way I say, "Mm mm hello little girl" When I see you passing by I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl" When I try to catch your eye I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl" I send you flowers but you don't care You never seem to see me standing there I often wonder what you're thinking of I hope it's me and love love love So I hope there'll come a day When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl" It's not the first time that it's happened to me, It's been a long lonely time And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind So I hope there'll come a day When you say, "Mm mm You're my little girl, mm mm mm You're my little girl, mm mm mm" You're my little girl, oh yeah You're my little girl Do do do do do
