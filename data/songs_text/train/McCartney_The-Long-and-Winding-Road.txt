The long and winding road, that leads, to your door Will never disappear, I've seen that road before It always leads me here, lead me to your door The wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day Why leave me standing here, let me know the way Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried Any way you'll never know, the many ways I've tried And still they lead me back, to the long winding road You left me standing here a long long time ago Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door But still they lead me back to the long winding road You left me standing here, a long long time ago Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to your door Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
