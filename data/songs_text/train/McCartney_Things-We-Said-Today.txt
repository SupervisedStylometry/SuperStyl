You say you will love me  If I have to go  You'll be thinking of me Somehow I will know  Wishing you weren't so far away Then I will remember  The things we said today You say you'll be mine, girl Until the end of time  These days such a kind girl  Seems so hard to find  Someday when we're dreaming Deep in love, not a lot to say  Then we will try to remember  The things we said today Me, I'm just the lucky kind  Love to hear you say that love is luck  And, though we may be blind Love is here to stay And that's enough  To make you mine, girl Be the only one  Love me all the time, girl  We'll go on and on  Someday when we're dreaming Deep in love, not a lot to say  Then we will try to remember  The things we said today Love me all the time, girl  We'll go on and on  Someday when we're dreaming Deep in love, not a lot to say  Then we will try to remember  The things we said today
