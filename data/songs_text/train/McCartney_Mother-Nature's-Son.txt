Born a poor young country boy Mother Nature's son All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone. Sit beside a mountain stream See her waters rise Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies. Find me in my field of grass Mother Nature's son Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun. Mother Nature's son.
