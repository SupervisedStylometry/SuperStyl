Once there was a way, To get back homeward. Once there was a way To get back home. Sleep, pretty darling, Dot not cry And I will sing a lullaby. Golden slumbers, Fill your eyes Smiles await you when you rise Sleep pretty darling Do not cry And I will sing a lullaby. Once there was a way To get back homeward Once there was a way To get back home Sleep, pretty darling Do not cry And I will sing a lullaby.
