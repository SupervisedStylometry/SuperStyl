I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door And kept my mind from wandering Where it will go And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. See the people standing there who disagree and never win And wonder why they don't get in my door I'm painting my room in the colourful way And when my mind is wandering There I will go And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right Where I belong I'm right Where I belong. Silly people run around they worry me And never ask me why they don't get past my door I'm taking the time for a number of things That weren't important yesterday And I still go I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in And stops my mind from wandering Where it will go
