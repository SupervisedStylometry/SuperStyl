Standing in the dock at Southampton Trying to get to Holland or France The man in the mac said You've got to go back You know they didn't even give us a chance Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Finally made the plane into Paris Honeymooning down by the Seine Peter Brown call to say You can make it O.K. You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton Talking in our beds for a week The newspapers said Say what're you doing in bed I said we're only trying to get us some peace Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Saving up your money for a rainy day Giving all your clothes to charity Last night the wife said Oh boy when you're dead You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think Made a lightning trip to Vienna Eating chocolate cake in a bag The newspapers said She's gone to his head They look just like two gurus in drag Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me Caught the early plane back to London Fifty acorns tied in a sack The men from the press Said we wish you success It's good to have the both of you back Christ you know it ain't easy You know how hard it can be The way things are going They're going to crucify me The way things are going They're going to crucify me
