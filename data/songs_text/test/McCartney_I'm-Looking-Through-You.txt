I'm looking through you, where did you go  I thought I knew you, what did I know You don't look different, but you have changed  I'm looking through you, you're not the same Your lips are moving, I cannot hear Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear You don't sound different, I've learned the game I'm looking through you, you're not the same Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?  Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight You're thinking of me the same old way You were above me, but not today The only difference is you're down there I'm looking through you and you're nowhere Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?  Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight I'm looking through you, where did you go  I thought I knew you, what did I know  You don't look different, but you have changed I'm looking through you, you're not the same
