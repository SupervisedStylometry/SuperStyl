Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe. Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind, Possessing and caressing me. Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, They call me on and on across the universe. Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box, They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe. Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing Through my open ears inciting and inviting me. Limitless, undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, And calls me on and on across the universe. Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva...
