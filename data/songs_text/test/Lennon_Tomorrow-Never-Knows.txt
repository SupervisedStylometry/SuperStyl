Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream It is not dying, it is not dying Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void It is shining, it is shining Yet you may see the meaning of within It is being, it is being Love is all and love is everyone It is knowing, it is knowing... ... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead It is believing, it is believing But listen to the colour of your dreams It is not living, it is not living So play the game "Existence" to the end... ... Of the beginning, of the beginning Of the beginning, of the beginning Of the beginning, of the beginning Of the beginning, of the beginning
