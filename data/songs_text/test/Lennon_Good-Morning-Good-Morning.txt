Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been Nothing to do it's up to you I've got nothing to say but it's okay Good morning, good morning Going to work don't want to go feeling low down Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town Everybody knows there's nothing doing Everything is closed it's like a ruin Everyone you see is half asleep And you're on your own you're in the street Good morning, good morning After a while you start to smile now you feel cool Then you decide to take a walk by the old school Nothing has changed it's still the same I've got nothing to say but it's okay Good morning, good morning People running round it's five o'clock Everywhere in town is getting dark Everyone you see is full of life It's time for tea and meet the wife Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear Go to a show you hope she goes I've got nothing to say but it's okay Good morning, good morning
