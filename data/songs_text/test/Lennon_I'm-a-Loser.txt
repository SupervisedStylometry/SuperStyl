I'm a loser I'm a loser And I'm not what I appear to be Of all the love I have won, and have lost There is one love I should never have crossed She was a girl in a million my friend I should have known she would win in the end I'm a loser And I lost someone who's near to me I'm a loser And I'm not what I appear to be Although I laugh and I act like a clown Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown My tears are falling like rain from the sky Is it for her or myself that I cry? I'm a loser And I lost someone who's near to me I'm a loser And I'm not what I appear to be What have I done to deserve such a fate? I realize I have left it too late And so it's true pride comes before a fall I'm telling you so that you won't lose all I'm a loser And I lost someone who's near to me I'm a loser And I'm not what I appear to be
