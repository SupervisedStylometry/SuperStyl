The sun is fading away That's the end of the day As the June light turns to moonlight I'll be on my way Just one kiss and I'll go Don't hide the tears that don't show As the June light turns to moonlight I'll be on my way To where the winds don't blow And golden rivers flow This way will I go They were right I was wrong True love didn't last long As the June light turns to moonlight I'll be on my way hey To where the winds don't blow And golden rivers flow This way will I go They were right I was wrong True love didn't last long As the June light turns to moonlight I'll be on my way hey I'll be on my way oh I'll be on my way oh I'll be on my way (fade out)
