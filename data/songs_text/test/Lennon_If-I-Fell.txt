If I fell in love with you Would you promise to be true And help me understand 'Cause I've been in love before And I found that love was more Than just holding hands If I give my heart to you I must be sure From the very start That you would love me more than her If I trust in you oh please Don't run and hide If I love you too oh please Don't hurt my pride like her 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain And I would be sad if our new love was in vain So I hope you see that I Would love to love you And that she will cry When she learns we are two 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain And I would be sad if our new love was in vain So I hope you see that I Would love to love you And that she will cry When she learns we are two If I fell in love with you
