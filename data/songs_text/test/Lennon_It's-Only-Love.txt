I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my) When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies) Why am I so shy when I'm beside you It's only love and that is all, Why should I feel the way I do It's only love and that is all, But it's so hard loving you Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night) Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright) Haven't I the right to make it up girl It's only love and that is all, Why should I feel the way I do It's only love and that is all, But it's so hard loving you Yes it's so hard loving you Loving you
