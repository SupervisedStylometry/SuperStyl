I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know. And it's true that it really only goes to show, That I know, That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue. Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry. And in time, you'll understand the reason why, If I cry, It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever had. I can't believe it's happened to me I can't conceive of any more misery. Ask me why, I'll say I love you, And I'm always thinking of you. I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
