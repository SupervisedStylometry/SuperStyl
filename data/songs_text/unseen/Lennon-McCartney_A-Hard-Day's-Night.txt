It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do Will make me feel alright You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone You know I feel ok When I'm home everything seems to be right When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight Owww! So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone You know I feel ok When I'm home everything seems to be right When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do Will make me feel alright You know I feel alright You know I feel alright...
