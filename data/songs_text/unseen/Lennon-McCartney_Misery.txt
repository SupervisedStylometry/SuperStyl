The world is treating me bad... Misery I'm the kind of guy Who never used to cry The world is treating me bad... Misery! I've lost her now for sure I won't see her no more It's gonna be a drag... Misery! I'll remember all the little things we've done Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one Send her back to me Cos everyone can see Without her I will be in misery I'll remember all the little things we've done She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one Send her back to me Cos everyone can see Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh) In misery (Ooh ee ooh ooh) My misery (La la la la la la)
