Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine Everybody does think a thing it didn't come Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone Looking at the bench of next door neighbors Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers Everybody's got to have something hard to hold Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun You gotta get out son and make you one You gotta get out son and make you one Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know Shoot big Shoot big Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get You gotta shoot big You gotta shoot big Until you shoot big I can't stand it
