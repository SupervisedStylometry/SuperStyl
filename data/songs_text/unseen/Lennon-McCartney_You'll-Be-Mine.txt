Well darling all the night You'll be mine and I know You'll be mine Till you die You'll be mine And so all the night You'll be mine You'll be mine And the stars Always shine You'll be mine Oh (My darling. When you burnt that toast the other morning I, I looked into you eyes and I could see that National Health eyeball and I loved you, like I never done, I have never done before!) Oh darling In your eyes And you'll be mine You will be mine You'll be mine At the star and so You'll be mine
