This happened once before When I came to your door No reply They said it wasn't you But I saw you peep through Your window I saw the light I saw the light I know that you saw me 'Cause I looked up to see Your face I tried to telephone They said you were not home That's a lie 'Cause I know where you've been And I saw you walk in Your door I nearly died I nearly died 'Cause you walked hand in hand With another man In my place If I were you, I'd realize that I Love you more than any other guy And I'll forgive the lies that I Heard before, when you gave me no reply I tried to telephone They said you were not home That's a lie 'Cause I know where you've been And I saw you walk in Your door I nearly died I nearly died 'Cause you walked hand in hand With another man In my place No reply No reply
