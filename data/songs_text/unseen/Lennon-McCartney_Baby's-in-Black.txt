She thinks of him And so she dresses in black And though he'll never come back She's dressed in black Oh dear, what can I do? Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue Tell me, oh what can I do? I think of her But she only thinks of him And though it's only a whim She thinks of him Oh how long will it take Till she sees the mistake she has made? Dear, what can I do? Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue Tell me, oh what can I do? Oh how long it will take Till she sees the mistake she has made? Dear, what can I do? Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue Tell me, oh what can I do? She thinks of him And so she dresses in black And though he'll never come back She's dressed in black Oh dear, what can I do? Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue Tell me, oh what can I do?
