On the road to Rishikesh I was dreaming more or less And the dream I had was true Yes, the dream I had was true I'm just a child of nature I don't need much to set me free I'm just child of nature I'm one of nature's children Sunlight shining in your eyes As I face the desert skies And my thoughts return to home Yes, my thoughts return to home I'm just a child of nature I don't need much to set me free I'm just a child of nature I'm one nature's children Underneath the mountain ranges Where the wind that never changes Touch the windows of my soul Touch the windows of my soul I'm just a child of nature I don't need much to set me free I'm just a child of nature I'm one of nature's children
