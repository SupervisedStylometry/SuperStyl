Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine. I need to laugh, and when the sun is out I've got something I can laugh about, I feel good, in a special way. I'm in love and it's a sunny day. Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine. We take a walk, the sun is shining down, Burns my feet as they touch the ground. Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine. And then we lie, beneath a shady tree, I love her and she's loving me. She feels good, she knows she's looking fine. I'm so proud to know that she is mine. Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine. Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine, Good day sunshine.
