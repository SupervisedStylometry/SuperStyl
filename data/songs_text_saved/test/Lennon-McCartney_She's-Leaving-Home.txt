Wednesday morning at five o'clock As the day begins Silently closing her bedroom door Leaving the note that she hoped would say more She goes downstairs to the kitchen Clutching her handkerchief Quietly turning the backdoor key Stepping outside, she is free She(we gave her most of our lives) Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives) Home (we gave her everything money could buy) She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye) Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown Picks up the letter that's lying there Standing alone at the top of the stairs She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy, our baby's gone. "Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly? How could she do this to me?" She (we never thought of ourselves) Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves) Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by) She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years Friday morning, at nine o'clock She is far away Waiting to keep the appointment she made Meeting a man from the Motortrade She (what did we do that was wrong) Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong) Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy) Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years She's leaving home, bye, bye
