Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you? Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see It is no surprise now, what you see is me Tell me what you see Listen to me one more time, how can I get through? Can't you try to see that I'm, trying to get to you? Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see It is no surprise now, what you see is me Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
