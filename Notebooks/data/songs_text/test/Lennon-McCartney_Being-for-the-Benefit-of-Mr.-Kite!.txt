For the benefit of Mr. Kite There will be a show tonight on trampoline The Hendersons will all be there Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene Over men and horses hoops and garters Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world! The celebrated Mr. K. Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate The Hendersons will dance and sing As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late Messrs. K and H. assure the public Their production will be second to none And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz! The band begins at ten to six When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound And Mr. H. will demonstrate Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground Having been some days in preparation A splendid time is guaranteed for all And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
