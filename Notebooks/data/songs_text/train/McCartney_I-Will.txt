Who knows how long I've loved you You know I love you still Will I wait a lonely lifetime If you want me to-- I will. For if I ever saw you I didn't catch your name But it never really mattered I will always feel the same. Love you forever and forever Love you with all my heart Love you whenever we're together Love you when we're apart. And when at last I find you Your song will fill the air Sing it loud so I can hear you Make it easy to be near you For the things you do endear you to me You know I will I will.
