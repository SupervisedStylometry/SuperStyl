If the rain comes  They run and hide their heads They might as well be dead If the rain comes If the rain comes When the sun shines  They slip into the shade And sip their lemonade When the sun shines When the sun shines Rain, I don't mind Shine, the weather's fine I can show you  That when it starts to rain Everything's the same I can show you I can show you Rain, I don't mind Shine, the weather's fine Can you hear me That when it rains and shines It's just a state of mind Can you hear me Can you hear me
