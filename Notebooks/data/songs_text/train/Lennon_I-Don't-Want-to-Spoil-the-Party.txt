I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go, I would hate my disappointment to show, There's nothing for me here so I will disappear, If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know. I've had a drink or two and I don't care, There's no fun in what I do if she's not there, I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long, I think I'll take a walk and look for her. Though tonight she's made me sad, I still love her, If I find her I'll be glad, I still love her.
