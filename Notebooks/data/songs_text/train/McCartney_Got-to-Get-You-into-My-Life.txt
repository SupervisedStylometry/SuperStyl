I was alone, I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there Another road where maybe I Could see another kind of mind there Ooh, then I suddenly see you Ooh, did I tell you I need you Every single day of my life You didn't run, you didn't hide And had you gone, you knew in time We'd meet again for I had told you Ooh, you were meant to be near me Ooh, and I want you to hear me Say we'll be together every day Got to get you into my life What can I do, what can I be When I'm with you I want to stay there If I'm true I'll never leave And if I do I know the way there Ooh, then I suddenly see you Ooh, did I tell you I need you Every single day of my life Got to get you into my life I was alone, I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there Another road where maybe I Could see another kind of mind there Ooh, then I suddenly see you Ooh, did I tell you I need you Every single day
