Lovely Rita, meter maid Nothing can come between us When it gets dark I tow your heart away Standing by a parking meter When I caught a glimpse of Rita Filling in a ticket in her little white book In a cap she looked much older And the bag across her shoulder Made her look a little like a military man Lovely Rita, meter maid May I inquire discreetly When are you free to take some tea with me? Rita! Took her out and tried to win her Had a laugh and over dinner Told her I would really like to see her again Got the bill and Rita paid it Took her home, I nearly made it Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid Where would I be without you Give us a wink and make me think of you
