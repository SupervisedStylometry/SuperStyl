Hey, Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill? He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun In case of accidents he always took his mom He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son. All the children sing Hey Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill? Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes All the children sing Hey, Bungalow Bill  What did you kill Bungalow Bill? The children asked him if to kill was not a sin Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in  If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him All the children sing Hey, Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill?
