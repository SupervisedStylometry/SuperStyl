For the other half of the sky Woman, I can hardly express, My mixed emotion at my thoughtlessness, After all I'm forever in your debt, And woman, I will try to express, My inner feelings and thankfulness, For showing me the meaning of success, Ooh, well, well, Ooh, well, well, Woman, I know you understand The little child inside the man, Please remember my life is in your hands, And, woman, hold me close to your heart, However distant don't keep us apart, After all it is written in the stars, Ooh, well, well, Ooh, well, well, Woman, please let me explain, I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain, So let me tell you again and again and again, I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever, I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever, I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever, I love you (yeah, yeah).
