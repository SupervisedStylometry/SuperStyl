Here I stand head in hand Turn my face to the wall If she's gone I can't go on Feeling two foot small Everywhere people stare Each and every day I can see them laugh at me And I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try? I can never win Hearing them, seeing them In the state I'm in How could she say to me "Love will find a way?" Gather round all you clowns Let me hear you say Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away
