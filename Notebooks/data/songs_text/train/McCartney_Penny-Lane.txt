Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs Of every head he's had the pleasure to know And all the people that come and go Stop and say "Hello" On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, And little children laugh at him behind his back And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain, very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass, And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes A four of fish and finger pies In summer. Meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray And though she feels as if she's in a play, She is anyway In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane!
